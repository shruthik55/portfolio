      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! Iâ€™m Shruthik G, a passionate B.Tech student at Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, with a strong foundation in Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Data Structures, and Object-Oriented Programming.
I have a keen interest in Data Science and Data Analytics, and Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience working with tools like MS Excel and Power BI. During my coursework, Iâ€™ve built several projects â€” from developing a Food Munch Website using web technologies to creating fun Python projects like a Rock-Paper-Scissors game and a Calculator.
Currently, Iâ€™m working on Machine Learning projects and exploring the field of Product Management to broaden my technical and analytical skill set.
I pride myself on being punctual, adaptable, and eager to learn emerging technologies like AI. Iâ€™m also a team player who enjoys collaborating on innovative ideas. Outside of academics, Iâ€™m actively involved in sports and have served as an NSS volunteer, contributing to community development.
Iâ€™m always open to learning new things and look forward to applying my skills to contribute to an organizationâ€™s growth and success.

      <h3>Used Car Price Prediction using Regression Models</h3>
      <p>
        This project focuses on predicting the prices of used cars based on various features such as manufacturer, year, mileage, fuel type, and engine capacity. Using the CRISP-DM methodology, I followed each stage of the data science process â€” from understanding business objectives to model deployment.
I performed data cleaning, transformation, and feature scaling, followed by label encoding of categorical variables. Multiple regression models were developed and evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score to identify the best-performing model.
Through exploratory data analysis and visualizations (heatmaps, regression plots, box plots), I identified that the year of production was the most significant factor influencing car prices. The project provides valuable insights for improving pricing strategies and advertising approaches for used car businesses.

      <h3>Food Munch Website</h3>
      <p>
        The Food Munch Website is a responsive food ordering platform built using HTML, CSS. It allows users to explore a variety of dishes, view restaurant details, and get an engaging food-ordering experience through a clean and user-friendly interface.
I focused on creating an interactive and visually appealing design using modern web design principles, ensuring that the website adapts smoothly to different screen sizes and devices. The project demonstrates my ability to build fully functional static web pages, manage layouts with flexbox and grid, and implement navigation bars, image galleries, and cards for displaying food items.
This project helped me strengthen my front-end development skills and gain hands-on experience in responsive design, UI/UX structure, and website performance optimization.
Tech Stack: HTML, CSS
